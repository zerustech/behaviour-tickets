# ZerusTech Behaviour Tickets
The *ZerusTech Behaviour Tickets* project provides image and template files that
can be used to print behaviour management tickets for kids. I guess there is no
need to explain why I created this project, so hopefully, it will also be helpful
to those who have been driven crazy by their kids :P
